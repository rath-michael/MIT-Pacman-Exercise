## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my Pacman exercise that I'm working on for the MIT xPro coding course. This project has two buttons: one to populate the page with Pacmen, and another to begin the action. Each time you click the add button, a new Pacman will appear and begin moving about the screen. The Pacmen also check for collisions with the page limits every iteration of movement and self correct as necessary.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap v5.0

## Setup
To run and see this project, download locally, extract the files, and run the index.html file in your local browser.

## Roadmap
* The change in animation between the mouth open / mouth close needs to be updated to look correct
* I would like to have each individual Pacman object check for, and correct as necessary, any collissions with other Pacmen objects.
